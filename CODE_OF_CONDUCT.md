Why this code of conduct?
DireMonkey engine is aimed to serve the needs of indie game developpers. People who want to make games
come from all backgrounds, and thus are a very diverse group of people. For this reason, 
we want to make it so our community is the most inclusive possible.

Here is what we expect:
-Act in a respectful way towards others.
-Be graceful when you recieve constructive criticism.
-Please understand that we all have different experiences and different views and sensibilities, and thus
might not understand the way you see things.
-Always assume the best from others, unless what you see is blatant abuse.
-Be honest and upfront.
-Don't hesitate to raise any issues.

Here are some conducts that we deem unacceptable:
-Racism, sexism, harassment in all shape or form (including reporting someone for an imaginary offence).
-Breaking laws
-Threats

Our responsabilities:
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsability to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

A person with a position of authority found abusing it will immediately be demoted
(This is meant to prevent people using their powers to the detriment of others.)


Scope of this code of conduct:
At any time where you act as a part of the DireMonkey community, this code of conduct applies. This includes
the discord, and interactions made with other people using your official email adress. Please note that we
don't want to infringe on people's personnal lives and thus will not intervene if you've done some less than
savory stuff on your own time, but whenever you act as a part of this community, please behave.

Enforcement:
You may report issues to any moderator or manager of this project.
Action will be taken if it is deemed that this code of conduct has been breeched.
Consequences may range from simple warnings to an exclusion from the project (which would mean that you
would be barred access to anything that is project related and any of your contribution to this project
would be systematically reverted when found.)
Honestly, we don't want to punish anyone and will try to make people aware of the rules if there is an
issue. However believe me when I tell you that you do not want to get on our bad side. We won't hesitate to
act swiftly and decisively for any grave offence and there will be no second chances.
