## Rules

Anyone is welcome to contribute to the engine, provided you follow the rules. Violating these rules may result in your access to the repostiory being removed and your changes to the code being reverted.

1. Be respectful. Disagreements do not give you the right to be rude to the others. If you want to see what are our boundries, please look up our code of conduct for more information.
2. When you make commits, please make sure those are on a branch. Commits directly to master without explicit permission will be reverted.
3. When you merge, please make a pull request, so that people can compare your work to what is already in the engine and investigate to make sure there is no issue with the code being merged.
